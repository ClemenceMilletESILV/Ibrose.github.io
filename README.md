Title: NUGU Pokémon communicator and suggester for Pokémon-fan kids

Resarch proposal

Kids like someone else agreeing their opinions. Also, many kids love Pokémon. If NUGU agrees kid’s opinions that they like, and even sometimes suggests those who have similar characteristics to what they like, then kids will like it more. Also luckily, I get an information that there was an official Pokémon popularity vote. According to this data, I will give popular points to each Pokémon based on popularity, those with high rank gets more higher points (top 1 = 10 points, top 2 = 9 points until top 10 = 1 points). And I will give additional points to several Pokémon that tend to be popular to kids (famous, legendary Pokémon, appeared recently, etc.). NUGU will reply pokemon with high points, and according to the users’ answers, it additionally adds points to a pokemon so the answer priority changes. Also, each pokemon will have values ‘Cute’ or ‘Cool’, and have one value as 1 and the other is 0. According to user’s answers, it can add Cute or Cool value of each pokemon, and using prior answers, it checks what user likes more and suggests you with pokemon with Cute/Cool value.
